# Boid Simulator

This project is a test for when modding is added to Vectorio, the plan is to have many enemies pathing towards the player.

However, if there were lots of enemies pathing at the same time, that would cause significant lag, so this system is designed to
use boid like movement to have many 'follower' enemies follow a pathfinding 'leader' enemy. This allows for significant scaling in the 
amount of enemies involved.

## Use

To use this, just download the files and run the main one. There are some commands you can run in the terminal, to get them just type help.
